# fai-2019-challenge

This is submission of the [challenge](https://fellowship.ai/challenge) of the Fellowship.AI 2019, for which I took the [ULMFiT Sentiment](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html) problem.

The most important sections are:

- [Part 1: Language Model and Fine Tuning](Twitter%20US%20Airline%20Sentiment%20-%201.%20Language%20Model.ipynb)
- [Part 2: Text Classification Task with ULMFiT](Twitter%20US%20Airline%20Sentiment%20-%202.%20Classifier%20with%20ULMFiT.ipynb)
- The discussion at the end of part 2, with some ideas of weaknesses and possible improvements.

But to have a complete picture:
- Part 0 deals with exploring the data set and trying different feature extraction approaches
- Part 3 is a "bonus" with multi-class classification (including the neutral cases)
